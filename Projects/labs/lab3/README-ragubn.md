Lab 3 - Git & Bugs

Below are the links to my personal Github repo for this course, as well as my groups' link to our repo for our project in this course. I also made sure to share my repo with you and plotka, and our groups is also shared as well.   
For my local computer I have the github desktop application setup, as well as a local file created (filepath - C:\Users\Natasha Ragubir\Documents\GitHub\ITWS4500-ragubn) so when I make changes in that folder I can easily commit and sync the changes to my remote github repo. I can also make pull requests as well.  

For bug tracking I am using MantisBT, I have several screenshots going the process of setup, but the last three are where I show creating a project(5), reporting an issue(6) and closing an issue using Mantis(7). The other screenshots are just references, for me to keep and for you if you need to see how I went about installation. 

In our groups readme you will find the information for our server and bug tracking details, as well as a short description of our project and our team members.
