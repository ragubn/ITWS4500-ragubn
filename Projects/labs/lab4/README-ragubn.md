Lab 4 - Responsive App

For this lab I am using two apis, one is the newsapi.org and the other is NASA's open api. I have an applicaiton that displays the latest news articles for google, national geographic, techCrunch, as well as the NASAs astronomy photo of the day (apod). This lab is built off of the example in class, in terms of buttons and angular. I have buttons where the user can click to choose which news source they want to see information from. 

These apis are updated, Nasa - daily, and the the news as often as they can. I have four api calls, one per view. 

For the media queries, I changed the background, positioning, and styling of the contents of the page for media devices with a max width of 500px, or under. I used the google toggle view to help me see what that code will look like. And my code is commented for you to follow along.

On another note, this week as been very hectic for me, I tried my best to get the lab done in time and with all of the necessary parts. I spoke to you about getting an extension today, due to having a test earlier, and you allowed one hour. But I was able to finish in time. Thank you for that time extra though.
